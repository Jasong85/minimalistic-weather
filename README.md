# minimalistic-weather
A minimalistic weather app in Java. Made for a class.

##Todo:
+ [NDFD REST service](http://graphical.weather.gov/xml/rest.php)
..+ Do timestamps (shouldn't be too bad. In the format of YYYY-MM-DD"T"HH:MM)
..+ Use ZIP codes instead of lat/long b/c that's way easier
..+ Units - not hard at all. Provide an option for the user to switch b/w metric and imperial
..+ Figure out which [elements](http://graphical.weather.gov/xml/docs/elementInputNames.php "element names") to use for the app.
+ [Parse the XML](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/appdev.111/b28394/adx_j_parser.htm "java xml parsing"). I know at least one of those libraries is built in.
+ Do the GUI -- remember minimalistic. Not fancy. As few images as possible. Use as little memory as possible.
